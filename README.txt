# Tummy hurt mod [Link Text](https://github.com/dariusxdmemes/TummyHurtMod)
## Description
Welcome to my first Minecraft modding project, this is a simple mod that modifies the eating mechaninc in Minecraft,
the idea of this mod comes just out of curiosity of trying to learn how to mod Minecraft, so yeah, in this mod
basically I try to replicate the "real" hunger or eating behavior, the player can still eat even though his hunger bar
is maxed, this will show an alert such as "You're full", if you still eat you'll start to feel sick and throw up
(not actually throwing up lol).

## How does this work?
At the moment I only want to modify basic game mechanics (food items), since these items are the only ones that replenish the food bar, so
depending of the saturation level of any food item there's 3 states of the player: hungry, full, sick:

+ **Hungry:** The player can eat as usually, there's not changes in there.
+ **Full:** The player has replenished his food bar and ate again, he gets a "_Wellness_ buff".
+ **Sick*:* The player has ignored being full and he felt sick and threw up (gets a low hunger bar, with nausea, slowness and weakness).

## Why this?
I don't know since I'm learning Java I always wanted to create a mod for Minecraft so I can play it with my friends,
aside from that I really enjoy learning how the game works and trying new things as a developer.
